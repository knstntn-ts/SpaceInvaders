# Space Invaders
Classic game of Space Invaders

Implemented using Turtle module in Python. Contains one ship and 18 invaders who are approaching the sihp. Purpose of the ship is to destroy the invaders before they reach it and destroy Earth!

## Getting started
To get started all you need to do is to download all the files from this directory and run main.py. Play around and see if you enjoy the gameplay.

## Smoothing out the gameplay
* If the game seems t0o jittery to you, play around with 'time.sleep(0.01)'. In my experience this seemed to improve/worsen the flow.
* Ships are hit by some invisible force? Try changing with 'margin_x' variable, set it to something lower.

## Issues
Feel free to roast this work ;) I will adjust it to your needs.
